## Architecture and Structure

1. **MVVM Architecture**
   - Implement strict MVVM separation (Model, ViewModel, View)
   - ViewModels should conform to `ObservableObject`
   - Models should be independent of UI concerns
   - Views should be thin and presentation-focused

2. **File Organization**
   - Group files by feature rather than type
   - Keep views and their associated ViewModels in the same directory
   - Create dedicated directories for reusable components
   - Separate audio engine components from UI components

3. **Naming Conventions**
   - Views should end with "View" (e.g., `TrackView`)
   - ViewModels should end with "ViewModel" (e.g., `TrackViewModel`)
   - Models should have clear domain names (e.g., `AudioTrack`)
   - Extensions should be in separate files with descriptive names
